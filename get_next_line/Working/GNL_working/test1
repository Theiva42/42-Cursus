Notes:
Aliases are simple text substitutions and cannot accept arguments or parameters like functions can. If you need more flexibility, consider using shell functions instead.
Avoid using existing command names for aliases to prevent confusion and potential issues.
Creating and managing aliases can significantly streamline your command-line workflow by reducing typing and making complex commands more accessible.
